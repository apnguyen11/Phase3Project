This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Photo Portfolio

The purpose of this project was to create a photographic portfolio of images that I have taken

## Technologies Used

React, React Router, Create React App, Reactstrap, Firebase Realtime Database, EmailJs

## About

The main focus on this project was to learn how to properly use React and React components with bootsrap in order to create an image gallery with versatile popup lightbox modals. Additionally, also to create a from to receive emails from potential clients. The images were stored in firebase storage and an array of objects containing the bootsrap card information were stored in a database in firebase. 

## Challenges

Creating a popup modal that worked precisely with vertical and horizontal images inside a bootstap card. This was achieved by creating a react component for the images within the bootsrap cards that had a local state. Creating a form to recieve emails was also another challenge, but was made extremely simple with EmailJs.
